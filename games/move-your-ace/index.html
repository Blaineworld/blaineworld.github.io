			is a card game for 2-4 players where the goal is to gain as many points as possible by
			the end of the game by saving the cards you play, which is done by matching the suit of
			the card your ace lands on in the loop with the one you played to get it there. Er, it
			will make more sense once you read the instructions…
			<br>
			I recommend playing two rounds per game.

			<p class="usual">
				There is a <dfn>loop</dfn> of face cards in the center of the table. Each player is
				assigned an ace which starts on the king of the same suit. In front of each player
				is a 10 of the same suit as their ace to show everyone which ace belongs to whom.
				The <dfn>deck</dfn> players draw from is face-down in the middle of the table. There
				will be a face-up pile of cards next to it called the <dfn>discard pile</dfn>, where
				discarded cards go. Each player will have a separate face-down pile of cards called
				a <dfn>score pile</dfn> for cards added to their scores. Each player starts with two
				cards in their <dfn>hand</dfn>.

			<h2 class="center">How to Play</h2>
			<p class="usual">
				Players take turns in a clockwise fashion. If a player's ace is covered by another,
				their turn is skipped until their ace is uncovered. On your turn, draw a card and
				add it to your hand. Then, choose any card from your hand to play and move your ace
				clockwise around the loop by the number of spaces indicated on that card. Different
				things happen depending on the suit of the card your ace lands on. Landing on
				another player's ace counts as landing on the ace, not the card under it.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If it matches your ace, take another turn. Otherwise, the player to your left
					goes next.
				</li>
				<li>
					If it matches the card you played, add that card to your score pile. Otherwise,
					add it to the discard pile.
				</li>
				<li>
					If it is another player's ace, their turn will be skipped until you move your
					ace off of it.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="usual">
				When the deck runs out, another round can be played by flipping the discard pile
				over and using that as a deck. At the end of the game, each player's score is
				calculated by adding up the numbers on the cards in their score pile. The player
				with the highest score wins.

			<h2 class="center">Setting It Up</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Separate the deck into face cards, aces and 10s, and the remaining numbers.
					Set any other cards aside; they will not be used.
				</li>
				<li>
					Arrange the face cards face-up into a closed loop in the pattern: king, queen,
					jack, repeat; spade, heart, club, diamond, repeat.
				</li>
				<li>
					Place one ace face-up on the king of the same suit per player. Place the 10 of
					the same suit as each player's ace face-up in front of them. Set any other aces
					and 10s aside; they will not be used.
				</li>
				<li>
					Shuffle the numbers and place them face-down in the middle of the table, leaving
					room for another pile of cards.
				</li>
				<li>
					Deal two numbers from the top of the deck to each player.
				</li>
			</ol>
